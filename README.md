# web-cli

My first attemp with Web Components for creating a a web development console like the console in FPS games (Quake, Unreal, etc....). Open the web development console with   `ctrl + \`.

## Usage

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To run a development server in hot module reloading mode:

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```
